Project Overview
Project Name: FalconBase

Description: FalconBase is a hybrid database system designed to combine the best features of relational (SQL) and NoSQL (document) databases, all while leveraging the power of PostgreSQL as its underlying storage engine. FalconBase will allow users to seamlessly store and query both structured (relational) data and semi-structured (NoSQL/document) data in one unified database system. The goal is to provide flexible, high-performance querying across different data models and use cases, offering an adaptable solution that can scale and handle varied data types.

Goals and Features
The database will be built with Golang for performance and scalability. The features will be implemented incrementally, starting from the simplest and progressing toward more complex functionalities.

Key Features to Implement
Basic Setup and Storage (MVP):

Relational Data Store: Implement a simple relational store using PostgreSQL as the storage backend, ensuring it can handle basic SQL operations (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Document-Based Storage: Add support for document storage (like JSON). Implement basic storage and retrieval of semi-structured data using PostgreSQL's jsonb type.
Simple SQL Queries: Implement basic SQL queries for relational data. Users should be able to perform traditional relational operations such as filtering, aggregation, and joins.
Hybrid Query Engine:

Support for Hybrid Queries: Allow users to query both structured and semi-structured data using a single query. This will involve building an abstraction layer that translates NoSQL queries into SQL queries on PostgreSQLâ€™s relational store.
Basic Document Querying: Implement a simple query engine that allows querying of document-based data (e.g., JSON) using SQL-like syntax.
ACID Compliance: Ensure that the database supports ACID transactions for both relational and document stores, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Advanced Indexing:

Hybrid Indexing: Develop indexing mechanisms that can handle both structured relational data (e.g., B-tree, hash indexes) and semi-structured data (e.g., GIN indexes for JSONB in PostgreSQL).
Full-Text Search for Documents: Implement full-text search indexing on JSON fields to allow efficient searching of document data (similar to Elasticsearch but built on PostgreSQL).
Improved Query Optimization:

Query Optimization Layer: Develop a query planner that optimizes the execution of hybrid queries (those involving both relational and document-based data). The system should intelligently choose the best execution plan.
Caching Layer: Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed documents or query results, enhancing performance and reducing load times.
Distributed Transactions and Consistency:

Distributed ACID Transactions: Implement support for distributed transactions, ensuring that both relational and document stores maintain consistency across multiple nodes.
Eventual Consistency (Optional): For cases where high availability is critical, implement support for eventual consistency in certain distributed scenarios, providing users with flexible consistency models.
Multi-Model Support:

Graph Database Support: Add support for graph queries (e.g., for social networks or relationship-heavy applications). This could involve building a graph querying API similar to Cypher or Gremlin.
Key-Value Store Integration: Provide support for simple key-value lookups, allowing FalconBase to store basic data in a key-value format for fast retrieval.
Cloud-Native Features:

Serverless Database: Introduce serverless capabilities where users can interact with the database without worrying about infrastructure, allowing automatic scaling based on demand.
Cross-Region Replication: Implement multi-region replication to ensure low-latency access to data globally, along with built-in fault tolerance.
Security and Compliance:

Encryption: Implement encryption at rest and encryption in transit to ensure data privacy and security.
Access Control: Provide fine-grained access control, ensuring that users can specify who can access which parts of the database (both relational and document stores).
Auditing and Logging: Add logging and audit trails for all data operations, including read and write queries, to maintain compliance with industry standards.
Development Roadmap (Simple to Hardest)
Phase 1: Basic Database Setup

Set up PostgreSQL as the backend storage engine.
Implement basic SQL operations (CRUD) for relational data.
Set up basic support for JSON-based storage (using jsonb in PostgreSQL).
Allow users to store and retrieve document-based data.
Phase 2: Hybrid Query Engine

Implement an abstraction layer for handling hybrid queries (mixing relational SQL and document querying).
Ensure ACID compliance for both types of data.
Implement basic document queries using SQL-like syntax (e.g., filtering and retrieving specific fields in JSON documents).
Phase 3: Indexing and Search

Add indexing support for both relational and document-based data (e.g., GIN indexes for JSONB).
Implement full-text search indexing on document fields.
Optimize query execution by adding an intelligent query planner for hybrid queries.
Phase 4: Performance Optimization

Build an in-memory caching layer to speed up query responses.
Optimize the query execution engine for faster hybrid query execution.
Improve the scalability of the system by experimenting with distributed query execution.
Phase 5: Distributed Transactions and Consistency

Implement support for distributed ACID transactions.
Introduce eventual consistency where appropriate (for high-availability scenarios).
Phase 6: Multi-Model Support

Add graph database capabilities for querying relationships between data points.
Implement support for key-value lookups for fast retrieval of simple data.
Improve multi-model query support to allow seamless integration between relational, document, and graph models.
Phase 7: Cloud-Native Features and Deployment

Implement serverless capabilities to automatically scale the database based on demand.
Add multi-region replication for global data distribution and fault tolerance.
Phase 8: Security and Compliance

Introduce data encryption at rest and in transit.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained security.
Add audit logs to track all database operations for compliance.
Technologies and Tools
Golang: The primary language for building the core of FalconBase due to its performance, concurrency handling, and simplicity in system-level programming.
PostgreSQL: As the relational database engine for structured data, and to handle document-based data via its jsonb feature.
JSONB Indexing: For handling document-style data, enabling efficient indexing and querying.
GIN and GiST Indexes: For indexing and optimizing queries over JSON data and other semi-structured formats.
Caching: Use tools like Redis or Memcached to cache query results and document data to reduce latency.
Graph Databases (optional): Integrate with Neo4j or implement a graph querying layer within FalconBase.
Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.
Kubernetes: For scaling and managing the database in cloud-native environments.
TLS/SSL: For encryption in transit.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For authentication and access control.
