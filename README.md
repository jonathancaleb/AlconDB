# AlconDB

AlconBase is a hybrid database system engineered to combine the best features of both relational (SQL) and NoSQL (document) databasesâ€”all while leveraging PostgreSQL as its underlying storage engine.

## Features

### Versioned Key-Value Store (Time-Travel)

- **Description:** Retrieve the historical state of a key.
- **Problem Solved:** Makes debugging and audits easier.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Introduces time-travel queries for keys.

### Schema-Aware Keys

- **Description:** Define schemas for your values to ensure data validity.
- **Problem Solved:** Prevents invalid data storage, reducing production errors.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Combines schema validation with a key-value paradigm.

### Geographic-Aware Partitioning

- **Description:** Store data closer to its primary access location.
- **Problem Solved:** Reduces latency for geographically distributed systems.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Provides built-in support for geospatial awareness.

### Lightweight Indexing

- **Description:** Introduce optional secondary indexes for specific query patterns.
- **Problem Solved:** Enables simple range scans or filtered lookups without heavy overhead.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Minimal overhead compared to traditional index-heavy databases.

### Event Streaming Support

- **Description:** Emit events whenever a key is changed or accessed.
- **Problem Solved:** Facilitates the development of reactive systems and debugging of real-time flows.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Features a built-in event-driven architecture.

### Built-in Compression

- **Description:** Seamless compression for data storage to conserve space.
- **Problem Solved:** Helps reduce storage costs for large datasets.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Offers lightweight, configurable compression on a per-key or per-value basis.

### Offline-First Support

- **Description:** Provides a seamless user experience in disconnected or weakly connected environments.
- **Problem Solved:** Ideal for applications targeting users in poor connectivity areas.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Synchronization capabilities when connectivity is restored.

### Customizable Expiry Policies

- **Description:** Allows granular control over key expiration policies.
- **Problem Solved:** Enables customization for caching or session management needs.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Supports complex policies like TTL conditions (e.g., expire if unused for X hours)
