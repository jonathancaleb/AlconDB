# AlconDB

AlconBase is a hybrid database system designed to combine the best features of relational (SQL) and NoSQL (document) databases, all while leveraging the power of PostgreSQL as its underlying storage engine

Versioned Key-Value Store (Time-Travel)
Allow users to retrieve the historical state of a key.

Problem Solved: Debugging and audits become easier for developers.
Unique Differentiator: Introduce time-travel queries for keys.
Schema-Aware Keys
Allow developers to define schemas for their values to validate data.

Problem Solved: Prevents invalid data storage, reducing errors in production.
Unique Differentiator: Combine schema validation with a key-value paradigm.
Geographic-Aware Partitioning
Store data closer to where itâ€™s accessed most.

Problem Solved: Reduces latency for geographically distributed systems.
Unique Differentiator: Provide built-in support for geospatial awareness.
Lightweight Indexing
Introduce optional secondary indexes for specific patterns of queries.

Problem Solved: Allows for simple range scans or filtered lookups without full database overhead.
Unique Differentiator: Minimal overhead compared to traditional index-heavy databases.
Event Streaming Support
Emit events whenever a key changes or is accessed.

Problem Solved: Useful for building reactive systems and debugging real-time flows.
Unique Differentiator: Built-in event-driven architecture.
Built-in Compression
Provide seamless compression for data storage to save space.

Problem Solved: Reduces storage costs for large data sets.
Unique Differentiator: Lightweight, configurable compression per key or value.
Offline-First Support
Provide a seamless experience for disconnected or weakly connected environments.

Problem Solved: Useful for developers targeting users in areas with poor connectivity (e.g., Uganda).
Unique Differentiator: Sync capabilities when reconnected.
Customizable Expiry Policies
Allow granular control over key expiration policies.

Problem Solved: Tailor the database to fit specific caching or session needs.
Unique Differentiator: Complex policies like TTL with conditions (e.g., expire if unused for X hours).
